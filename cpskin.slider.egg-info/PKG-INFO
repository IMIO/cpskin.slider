Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provide integration between plone collection and flexslider. We
        import here:
          * jquery.flexslider.js
          * jquery.flexslider-min.js
          * flexslider.css
        
        from the last version of flexslider.
        
        
        We need to have the possibility to show collection result as a carousel.
        This package add:
          * a view for ICollection (new collection)
          * a view for IATTopic (old collection)
          * an extension of plone portlet collection with a custom view
        
        The last point over the other is the more interesting 'cause allow to add a
        slider in the page taking advantage of portlets and products like
        Products.ContentWellPortlet. Using this package user is able to create a slider
        over the content. This porltet can be used also in columns.
